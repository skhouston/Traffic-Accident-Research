# Traffic-Accident-Research

There have been a large amount of car accidents in the United States over the last few years. The
focus of this paper is to reliably predict the severity of an accident given certain parameters. Severity
in this paper refers to the length of time between the occurrence of an accident and traffic returning
to normal. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of using a neural network to find the desired outcome,
as well as comparing the results with other Machine Learning models. The highest accuracy for the 
Neural Network model comes to 0.77. Though this is an increase in accuracy based on randomly
guessing, it isnâ€™t a significant increase in accuracy when considering the response vector. The conclusion
I've drawn from my research is that the significance of individual drivers is more influencial than 
environmental factors of accidents. I believe that using data with individual driver characteristics
will yield higher accuracy in future models.
